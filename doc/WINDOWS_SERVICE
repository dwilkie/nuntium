Instructions to run delayed_job as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------------------

1. Install win32-service and win32-process gems (http://win32utils.rubyforge.org/):

     $ gems install win32-service
     $ gems install win32-process
  
2. From ~\lib\services dir invoke the services manager passing
   the appropiate option:

     $ ruby lib\services\delayed_job_daemon_ctl.rb [option] [mode]

   Options:
     install    - Installs the service.  The service name is "NuntiumWorker"
                  and the display name is "Nuntium Worker".
     start      - Starts the service.
     stop       - Stops the service.
     pause      - Pauses the service.
     resume     - Resumes the service.
     uninstall  - Uninstalls the service.
     delete     - Same as uninstall.
   
   The [mode] argument will be set to ENV["RAILS_ENV"] and can be
   'development', 'test' or 'production'.
     
   The service logs to the normal Ruby on Rails logger.
   
3. cron_daemon_ctl.rb can be installed in a similar fashion.
