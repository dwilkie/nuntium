Instructions to set up the application for the first time
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Ensure you have Ruby and SQLite3 installed.

2. Install the right version of rails:

gem install -v=2.3.4 rails

3. Run set up scripts:

rake gems:install
rake db:migrate
rake db:reset
rake db:seed

4. Run the web server:

ruby script/server

5. Run the delayed jobs worker:
(rake gems:install should add the "delayed_job" and "daemons" gems but, just in case, ensure you have them)

Unix: ruby script/delayed_job start

Windows: ruby script\console
and once in the console: Delayed::Worker.new.start
